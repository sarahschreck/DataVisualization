# Part 1

For my final project in this course, I have decided to use data visualization to help determine the top three cities in which I will seek out jobs, after graduation. This issue has been on my mind a lot recently, and I believe I am looking for a distinct blend of opportunities and environments. This project could be extremely beneficial for planning out my early career, and I believe there are ample data sets available to facilitate this exploration.

## Project Outline
In my final project page, I will include at least the following sections as data visualizations, maps, or similar depictions. These will be arranged as a funnel, organized by peronsal importance, until I arrive at three cities in the continguous United States:

- Price-to-be-happy (from a Forbes article that cited $75K to be baseline, how does cost of living affect states)
- Locations of non-profit arts organizations and/or LORT-registered theaters
- Rent prices for one-bedroom apartments
- One or more weather-related restrictions
- Number/mileage of parks
- Political party distribution

The final three cities may be described with the areavibes.com Livability scores, or using some form of data from the website (TBD based on data processing).

## Data Sources
I intend to aggregate my data from the following sources:
- areavibes.com
- The Council for Community and Economic Research (http://coli.org/, [used here](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/map-happiness-benchmark_n_5592194?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWNvc2lhLm9yZy8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAb1qwQZ94qP_OwRSE3cFZLQMhivzwA_KTvcQWLPMxQa_y3GzFXDiWZDjHuNcLT5JTmPD0OHjtqlsXJfH6ivx_oPhIrIR4cI3neaUYhe9rNUcp-exrHRK48xE3b3Qj4XFAvi5JhQ5xk0eXpFRpVt-Uqd9A-7y1gQNXrcT29qSqW4))
- [The Arts Vibrancy Index](http://mcs.smu.edu/artsresearch2014/arts-vibrancy-2018)
- [Data.gov federal, state, and organization data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=CSV#sec-organization)
- [This study on political conservatism in cities](http://ctausanovitch.com/Municipal_Representation_140502.pdf)
- [This listing of LORT (Leage of Resident Theaters) members] (http://lort.org/theatres)

I plan on using these different data sets to narrow down options of cities in which I plan to apply to jobs. Many of these provide information detailing quality of life, crime, income, arts vibrancy, air quality, and so on. I plan to use this data like a funnel, with my most important factors (namely, affordability and arts vibrancy) leading the charge. With each visualization fo data, I will develop a larger scale perspective of my prospective cities. I may use GIS mapping for some of these examples as well, if my data calls for it.

My final project will be hosted on Shorthand, and will tell the story of my search for Home 3.0. 

TA Matt has said that if I wind up back in Orlando, I'll have failed, so I'll do my best to steer clear of the swamps of home.

**My Target Audience**

My target audience is myself! This is a journey of discovery to find the place that best aligns with my interests. However, my visualizations may serve to help back up my choice of relocation to friends and family. This audience is personal, and I&#39;ll communicate with them using casual language and friendly design.

It might also be helpful for fellow young professionals who are pursuing arts-related careers.

**Interview Process**

Basic Questions:

- You can see the storyboard for my data visualization project. It will be on a scrolling website, going from top to bottom. I understand that a lot of my abbreviations don&#39;t make sense at this time, but what are your first impressions of this &quot;story through data?&quot;
- [Description of Project]
- Are there any elements that are missing that you believe would significantly impact my choice?
- Do you prefer seeing elements on a map or side-by-side?

Notes: Parents

- How to define LORT theatre?
- Feeling at home is very subjective
- Chamber of commerce should have price for single individual
- You&#39;re going to want to meet people, be recreational â€“ what is the average age? Do people have higher education, universities nearby?
- What is the weather like?
- Is transportation an issue? (I want to keep my car)
- Bubble map for nearby universities, recreation, etc
- Side by side &quot;to see all criteria,&quot; but have a map to show how you&#39;re making the selection smaller and smaller

Interview Notes: Friends

- What if there are a lot of LORT theatres outside of the vibrant art spaces
- Make sure you link to all of your sources
- I like the personality but don&#39;t make it cloud up what you&#39;re actually doing
- Does whether or not there&#39;s family in an area impact your decision?
- Would you have a budget going into this? Is there any way to know what your salary will be like so you can make informed decisions?

**Interview Findings &amp; Changes:**

Based on my interviews, I will edit my copy to be more straightforward, provide more definitions, and make sure to link to all sources. I have a lot of elements to consider at the final round that are more qualitative; things like the weather, closeness to family, etc. This is something I can visualize, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the kind of data to organize in tableau. I would like to include visualizations for average age in the area (I can&#39;t be single forever) and possibly transportation.

I think it will be useful at the final stage to use Esri marketing groupings by ZIP code; this breaks down a lot of lifestyle qualities by percentage of the population.



**First Draft / Wireframe: Finding My Way Home**

Hello! I&#39;m Sarah Schreck, a second-year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. In just a few months, I will graduate and be thrust into the big, scary world. Looking out of my pre-graduate window, I can see a landscape of housing values, job opportunities, and other environmental factors. Come with me as I pack my bags full of data and see just where the future awaits.

Let&#39;s Blue Sky.

My dream home. I&#39;ve never really had one, which is a blessing! But I know that the following elements are going to be important to me, in this order:

1. Are there jobs for me there in theatre or arts management?
2. Can I afford to live there?
3. Will I feel safe?
4. How many dogs will I see on my commute to work?

Okay, that last one might have to wait for further investigation.

## **PART 1: ARE THERE JOBS?**

Arts Vibrancy Map

The first thing I will use to narrow down my search is this Arts Vibrancy Map [add citations and links]. This organization narrowed down the top 20 large metropolitan and top 10 medium metropolitan areas, and ranked them by arts vibrancy. This reflects the number of artists, arts organizations, and arts-related jobs. This narrows my search down already to 30 mid-to-large communities.

**[MAP, TABLE, VISUALIZATIONS]**

Wonderful, all of these places have enough creative juices flowing that there will likely be jobs for me when the time comes to move. But my particular interest is in the performing arts. The League of Resident Theatres is the organization that unites non-profit theatres of substantial size. Here in Pittsburgh, there&#39;s the Pittsburgh Public Theatre and City Theatre.

This map shows the location of all LORT Theatres in the United States. You can see that not all top &quot;vibrant art&quot; cities have LORT theatres; after all, there are only 76 in total.

**[MAP]**

I don&#39;t mind working at a theatre that&#39;s smaller than a LORT theatre, but I&#39;m concerned about living in a state that doesn&#39;t have any LORT Theatres whatsoever. That&#39;ll probably where I find higher-paying work. A girl&#39;s gotta eat!

For that reason, I&#39;ll eliminate down Louisiana and Michigan.

Since we&#39;re in the first step, I suppose I should eliminate areas that I consider completely out of the question because of personal reasons.

Namely, New York City and Los Angeles. If I get bored, maybe I&#39;ll entertain moving there, but for now, that&#39;s too much excitement for me.

## **PART 2: CAN I AFFORD IT?**

Forbes released an article a while back that established $75,000 as the peak of the income experience. Once you make $75K, you don&#39;t get any happier. Whether or not this is true in practice, [this newspaper] adjusted this 75K based on the cost of living in different states in the United States. Of the states remaining on my list, this is how the

General price is one thing. But I have to live somewhere, don&#39;t I? I&#39;m moving to a new city all by my lonesome and have been spoiled to not have a roommate in Pittsburgh. Here is the spread of 1 Bedroom apartment rentals.

**[MAP, VISUALIZATION]**

Sounds like it may be tough to live in the top-rent areas. Maybe after my entry-level life has ceased, I can high-tail it to the uppercrust. For now, I&#39;ll have to eliminate the most expensive of all the rents.

## **PART 3: Will I feel safe there?**

Whether I like it or not, I&#39;m going to be living somewhere and my mom is going to want to believe I will survive. That means I should look at the crime statistics. But I also want my values to be reflected in the local government. Here&#39;s the spread of crime rates versus the political ideology of the areas left in the running:

Sounds like I&#39;ll be steering clear of the most dangerous and â€“ I&#39;ll be honest â€“ most right-leaning cities. This narrows it down to X metropolitan areas.
