For my final project in this course, I have decided to use data visualization to help determine the top three cities in which I will seek out jobs, after graduation. This issue has been on my mind a lot recently, and I believe I am looking for a distinct blend of opportunities and environments. This project could be extremely beneficial for planning out my early career, and I believe there are ample data sets available to facilitate this exploration.

## Project Outline
In my final project page, I will include at least the following sections as data visualizations, maps, or similar depictions. These will be arranged as a funnel, organized by peronsal importance, until I arrive at three cities in the continguous United States:

- Price-to-be-happy (from a Forbes article that cited $75K to be baseline, how does cost of living affect states)
- Locations of non-profit arts organizations and/or LORT-registered theaters
- Rent prices for one-bedroom apartments
- One or more weather-related restrictions
- Number/mileage of parks
- Political party distribution

The final three cities may be described with the areavibes.com Livability scores, or using some form of data from the website (TBD based on data processing).

## Data Sources
I intend to aggregate my data from the following sources:
- areavibes.com
- The Council for Community and Economic Research (http://coli.org/, [used here](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/map-happiness-benchmark_n_5592194?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWNvc2lhLm9yZy8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAb1qwQZ94qP_OwRSE3cFZLQMhivzwA_KTvcQWLPMxQa_y3GzFXDiWZDjHuNcLT5JTmPD0OHjtqlsXJfH6ivx_oPhIrIR4cI3neaUYhe9rNUcp-exrHRK48xE3b3Qj4XFAvi5JhQ5xk0eXpFRpVt-Uqd9A-7y1gQNXrcT29qSqW4))
- [The Arts Vibrancy Index](http://mcs.smu.edu/artsresearch2014/arts-vibrancy-2018)
- [Data.gov federal, state, and organization data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?res_format=CSV#sec-organization)
- [This study on political conservatism in cities](http://ctausanovitch.com/Municipal_Representation_140502.pdf)
- [This listing of LORT (Leage of Resident Theaters) members] (http://lort.org/theatres)

I plan on using these different data sets to narrow down options of cities in which I plan to apply to jobs. Many of these provide information detailing quality of life, crime, income, arts vibrancy, air quality, and so on. I plan to use this data like a funnel, with my most important factors (namely, affordability and arts vibrancy) leading the charge. With each visualization fo data, I will develop a larger scale perspective of my prospective cities. I may use GIS mapping for some of these examples as well, if my data calls for it.

My final project will be hosted on Shorthand, and will tell the story of my search for Home 3.0. 

TA Matt has said that if I wind up back in Orlando, I'll have failed, so I'll do my best to steer clear of the swamps of home.
