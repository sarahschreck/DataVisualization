## Part Three: The Final Data Story


My intended audience was mostly myself, my family, and people in my field looking for places to move. I made sure to conduct my user feedback with my parents and my peers, who caputre this demographic very specifically. In order to make this useful for my target audience, I included the downloadable data set so that viewers can do their own comparisons based on their monetary restrictions and tastes. If I were to do this project again, I may re-vision it as a holistic comparison of the Top 20 cities, in contrast to narrowing down the Top 30. This would expand the audience and appeal.

I designed the page with this audience in mind as well. I wanted to create a sense of fun, and a very clear personality/voice. This is my perosnal website, after all, and a very personal story! I wanted to have this page to reference as I move forward in life, and the more personality I imbued, the more diary-like it became. I will have this website as a reference for my data, but also my mindset and personality at the time of decision-making.

The work I've done thus far is constitued by storyboards, general research, introspection into what I most value in a home community, and a lot of experimentation in Tableau to create the ideal graphics. I struggled most with trying to expand outward from bar graphs, to little success. Sometimes the most effective graphic is not the most unusual! I found myself accidentally inserting data as "sums" instead of "attributes," which would skew my data massively. If I had the chance to do this project again, I would have deepend my search into a visualization that could categorize my top cities by my deciding factors.

Something else that occurred to me while working on this project was the idea of normalization. When I reviewed crime statistics, I was able to calculate crime rates. However, when I was looking at the median rent of one-bedroom apartments in different cities, these were not standardized by square footage. Perhaps there is a data set out there that could help with this normalization problem, but for the time being, I compared the price of the bedroom to the "cost of happiness" standard of living. If the cost of living was very high, but the rent price was very low, I assumed that the median one-bedroom apartment was essentially a one-partitioned shoebox.

I did find that I had to reevaluate the colors I used in my visualizations. I had switched from using purple hues to indicate the number of LORT theaters in the state (I wish I had statistical data about how many non-profit theaters there were in the area - a much higher number and a much smaller geographic area!) to using blue hues to indicate the level of liberalism in the area. However, this created an inconsistency. I had to recreate and re-color my visualization.

I added my final little graph about veterenarians just for fun, so I acknowledge it doesn't fit with the rest of the color scheme and aesthetic, but I hope any reader will recognize that it is more of a joke than anything else. 

I look forward to journaling my job search in a similar fashion moving forward! Perhaps I can visualize where I apply, where I interview, and where I am accepted. Then I will finally be able to produce an Alluvial diagram!
