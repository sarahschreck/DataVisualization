## **About Me**
### Short n Sweet
Hello! I'm Sarah (she/her/hers). I'm a second year Master of Arts Management student interested in the intersection of performing arts and national dialogue. I do some freelance graphic design on the side, but in my free time you can always find me entertaining some thoughts about dogs or cartoons from the good ol' days, running, weightlifting, or baking in my itty bitty kitchen.

Here's a peek at me from my trip to Seattle early this summer, posing at Pike Place Market. Everyone in my tour group asked to borrow my hand sanitizer. Can you even *imagine* the kind of germs on that gum wall???

### The Full Story
I call Orlando Florida my home-swamp, hurricanes and all. I grew up attending the Disney parks, and was very involved with local theatre. This helped guide me back for my undergraduate education at the University of Central Florida, where I majored in theatre and advertising and public relations, and minored in creative writing and performing arts administration. I decided I had sweat enough for one lifetime, and moved up north to cozy Pittsburgh to study arts management further.

Once I graduate, I expect to work as a marketing whiz for some time, before hopefully holding some leadership position. I would love to, one day, run a network of performing arts organizations that produce the work of a "sister city," somehow fostering cross-national dialogue through the production of brand new works.

## **What I Hope to Learn**
I am hoping that I will be able to think more outside-the-box with data representation after taking this class. I want to find compelling ways to connect the artists I work with to the data they need to know. I do a lot of work in marketing and data visualization is a phenomenal way to create meaningful content.
